Dangerous situations: (http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/692)
Here is the simplified algorithm used to determine the experience you will earn by performing an action:
Experience = Experience Gain associated to the action you perform (see table below) 
If the Improved Skill associated to the action you perform is between 04 and 11 (hidden Fighter and Ninja skills) 
and if no creature has attacked the party for at least 150 clock ticks (25 seconds), then Experience is divided by 2. 
If the Experience Multiplier of the current level is not 0, then Experience is multiplied by the Experience Multiplier 
If the Improved Skill associated to the action you perform is above 04 (any hidden skill) and if a creature has 
attacked the party less then 25 clock ticks ago (about 4.17 seconds), then Experience is multipled by 2. 
The computed Experience value is added to the Improved Skill associated to the action you performed. 
If this Improved Skill is one of the hidden skills, then the experience is also added to the basic skill.
